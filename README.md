# keygen.ts:
 
generates a new keypair and prints the public and private keys of this keypair to the screen.
I created a new sol wallet with yarn keygen command (pub key: 4JyzBzwn67sBfEtopQc2Bc1tPZJN2kj43wuvbScbNXVM)

# transfer.ts:

The code is written to perform a 0.01 SOL transfer from one wallet to another. First, a keypair is generated by extracting the private key from the dev-wallet.json file, and the destination wallet address for the transfer is specified. A connection is established to the Solana devnet (https://api.devnet.solana.com), a transfer transaction is created, and the transaction is added using the SystemProgram.transfer method. The transaction is then signed with the sending wallet's keypair, broadcasted, and confirmed. If the transaction is successful, the transaction details are printed to the console. If any errors occur during the process, the code catches and logs the errors to the console, informing the user.

# enroll.ts:

A keypair is generated using the private key from the dev-wallet.json file, and a connection to the Solana devnet (https://api.devnet.solana.com) is established, with the GitHub username set to "SimsekBerk". An AnchorProvider is used to create a provider, and the WbaPrereq program is loaded with this provider. Next, a Program Derived Address (PDA) is created using specific seeds. A transaction containing the specified GitHub username is executed by calling program.methods.complete(github). The transaction is signed with the keypair and broadcasted to the blockchain.
